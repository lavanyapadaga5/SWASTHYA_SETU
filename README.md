# SWASTHYA_SETU
SwasthyaSetu is a digital health record management system designed to make healthcare easier and more organized for everyone. It allows users to securely store and manage their medical records, prescriptions, test reports, and health notes in one place online.

This helps society by:

Improving Health Management: People can easily access and track their health records anytime without worrying about losing paper documents.

Saving Time for Doctors and Patients: Having digital records reduces repeated tests and helps doctors quickly understand patient history.

Promoting Health Awareness: Users become more aware and involved in their health by regularly updating and reviewing their records.

Reducing Paper Waste: Moving to digital reduces the need for physical files and supports eco-friendly healthcare.

Accessible for Everyone: Users from remote or rural areas can maintain health records without frequent hospital visits.

How this project works:

User Login & Registration: Users create an account and securely log in.

Add Health Records: Users can add new health information such as test results, prescriptions, or doctor visits by filling simple forms.

View Records Dashboard: All saved health records are shown as cards with details and dates in a user-friendly dashboard.

Interactive & Animated UI: The interface uses animations and a clean design to make the experience smooth and pleasant.

Secure Sessions: User sessions keep data private and only accessible after login.

Logout: Users can safely log out to protect their information.

Technical basics:

Built with Flask, a lightweight Python web framework.

Uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript for frontend with animations to enhance interaction.

Stores data in a database (can be SQLite or others) linked with Flask.

Organizes code to separate logic (Python) and presentation (HTML templates).

Uses Flask’s session management for user authentication.

This project makes healthcare management easy, accessible, and organized — helping individuals stay on top of their health and making a small positive change in society’s wellness.
